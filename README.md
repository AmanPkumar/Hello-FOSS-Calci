# HELLO-FOSS-Scientific Calculator

Hello There!
This project is a part of HELLO-FOSS: Celebration of Open Source by the Web and Coding Club. We will be building a Scientific Calculator, similar to the one installed on our cellphones. The Repo has been given the label of "Hacktoberfest". Refer to [Hello-FOSS](https://github.com/wncc/Hello-FOSS) for guidelines.
